            <h2>The Internet vs. The Web</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Internet</strong> and the <strong>Web</strong> are terms often used interchangeably, but they refer to different concepts. The Internet is a global network of networks that facilitates data exchange using standardized communication protocols. The Web, short for World Wide Web, is a service that operates over the Internet and consists of interconnected documents and multimedia content accessed via web browsers.</p>
            <h3>Key Differences</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Definition</strong>: The Internet is the infrastructure of interconnected networks, while the Web is a collection of documents and resources accessible over the Internet.</li>
                <li><strong>Protocols</strong>: The Internet uses protocols such as TCP/IP for data transmission. The Web specifically uses HTTP/HTTPS to transfer web pages.</li>
                <li><strong>Access</strong>: The Internet supports various services like email, file transfers, and online gaming. The Web is specifically concerned with web pages and hypertext documents.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Historical Context</h3>
            <p>The Internet's origins date back to the 1960s with the development of ARPANET by the U.S. Department of Defense. It evolved through various stages, including the introduction of TCP/IP in the 1970s and the establishment of the modern Internet in the 1980s. The Web was conceived by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 and made public in 1991, revolutionizing how information is accessed and shared.</p>

            <h2>Servers and Clients</h2>
            <p>In the context of the web, <strong>servers</strong> and <strong>clients</strong> represent the two main entities that interact to deliver content and services. Servers are powerful systems that provide resources and services to clients, which are devices or applications that request and use these resources.</p>
            <h3>Types of Servers</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Web Server</strong>: Hosts web pages and serves them to clients. Examples include Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft IIS.</li>
                <li><strong>Database Server</strong>: Manages and stores data, providing access to databases. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.</li>
                <li><strong>File Server</strong>: Stores and manages files, providing file access over a network. Examples include Samba and Windows Server.</li>
                <li><strong>Mail Server</strong>: Handles email communication, including sending, receiving, and storing emails. Examples include Microsoft Exchange and Postfix.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Client Devices and Applications</h3>
            <p><strong>Clients</strong> can be any device or application that interacts with a server. Common client devices include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Web Browsers</strong>: Applications like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge that request and display web content.</li>
                <li><strong>Mobile Devices</strong>: Smartphones and tablets that access web content via mobile browsers or apps.</li>
                <li><strong>Email Clients</strong>: Applications such as Outlook or Thunderbird that connect to mail servers to manage email.</li>
                <li><strong>FTP Clients</strong>: Programs like FileZilla used to transfer files between local machines and file servers.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Server-Client Interaction</h3>
            <p>The interaction between servers and clients follows a request-response model:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Request</strong>: A client sends a request to the server for a resource, such as a web page or file.</li>
                <li><strong>Processing</strong>: The server processes the request, which may involve querying a database or executing scripts.</li>
                <li><strong>Response</strong>: The server sends the requested resource back to the client, which is then displayed or used by the client application.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Web Page Addresses (URLs)</h2>
            <p>A <strong>URL</strong> (Uniform Resource Locator) is a reference used to access resources on the web. It is composed of several elements that together specify the location of a resource:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Protocol</strong>: Specifies the method used to access the resource, such as <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>Domain Name</strong>: Identifies the website, e.g., <code>www.example.com</code>. It often includes a top-level domain (TLD) like <code>.com</code>, <code>.org</code>, or <code>.net</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>Path</strong>: Indicates the specific location of the resource on the server, e.g., <code>/path/to/resource.html</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>Query String</strong>: (Optional) Provides additional parameters for the request, e.g., <code>?id=123&sort=asc</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>Fragment</strong>: (Optional) Refers to a specific section within the resource, e.g., <code>#section1</code>.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Examples and Breakdown</h3>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>URL</th>

            <h2>The Anatomy of a Web Page</h2>
            <p>Web pages are made up of several key components that work together to create and display content:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</strong>: The foundational markup language used to structure the content of web pages. HTML elements and tags define headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other content types.</li>
                <li><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong>: Styles the HTML elements to control their appearance. CSS allows developers to set colors, fonts, layouts, and other visual aspects, separating content from design.</li>
                <li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. JavaScript can manipulate HTML and CSS, handle user input, and communicate with servers to create responsive web applications.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Detailed Example of HTML Structure</h3>
            <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
        &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Sample Page&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;header&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Website&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;/header&gt;
        &lt;main&gt;
            &lt;section&gt;
                &lt;h2&gt;About Us&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;We are a company that values excellence and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/section&gt;
            &lt;section&gt;
                &lt;h2&gt;Contact&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;form&gt;
                    &lt;label for="name"&gt;Name:&lt;/label&gt;
                    &lt;input type="text" id="name" name="name"&gt;
                    &lt;label for="email"&gt;Email:&lt;/label&gt;
                    &lt;input type="email" id="email" name="email"&gt;
                    &lt;button type="submit"&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
                &lt;/form&gt;
            &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;/main&gt;
        &lt;footer&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&copy; 2024 My Website&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/footer&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>This example demonstrates the basic structure of an HTML document, including the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> sections, as well as typical elements like headers, sections, and forms.</p>
            <h3>CSS Styling</h3>
            <p>CSS is used to style the HTML elements. Below is an example of CSS rules and how they apply to HTML elements:</p>
            <pre><code>body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
}

h1 {
    color: #333;
}

a {
    color: #0066cc;
    text-decoration: none;
}

a:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
}</code></pre>
            <p>In this CSS example, the <code>body</code> rule sets the font and background color for the entire page, <code>h1</code> changes the color of headings, and <code>a</code> modifies the appearance of links. The <code>a:hover</code> rule adds an underline effect when a user hovers over a link.</p>
            <h3>JavaScript Functionality</h3>
            <p>JavaScript is used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. Below is an example of JavaScript code that responds to user actions:</p>
            <pre><code>document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
        alert('Button clicked!');
    });
});</code></pre>
            <p>This script waits for the DOM to load completely and then attaches an event listener to a button with the ID <code>myButton</code>. When the button is clicked, an alert message is displayed.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Web Protocols</h2>
            <p><strong>Web protocols</strong> are the rules and conventions used to facilitate communication between clients and servers. They ensure that data is transmitted efficiently and correctly across the Internet.</p>
            <h3>HTTP and HTTPS</h3>
            <p><strong>HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)</strong> is the foundation of data communication on the web. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted. <strong>HTTPS (HTTP Secure)</strong> is an extension of HTTP that includes encryption via SSL/TLS to secure data during transmission.</p>
            <h4>HTTP Methods</h4>
            <p>HTTP methods specify the type of action to be performed on a resource. Common methods include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>GET</strong>: Requests data from a specified resource.</li>
                <li><strong>POST</strong>: Submits data to be processed by a specified resource.</li>
                <li><strong>PUT</strong>: Updates data at a specified resource.</li>
                <li><strong>DELETE</strong>: Deletes data from a specified resource.</li>
                <li><strong>HEAD</strong>: Retrieves headers from a specified resource without the body.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>HTTPS Security</h4>
            <p>HTTPS uses SSL/TLS to encrypt data transmitted between clients and servers, protecting against eavesdropping and tampering. A website using HTTPS is identified by a padlock icon in the browser's address bar.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>How Web Pages are Displayed</h2>
            <p>The process of displaying a web page involves several stages:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Request</strong>: When you enter a URL in your browser or click a link, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server hosting the web page.</li>
                <li><strong>Response</strong>: The server processes the request and sends back the requested HTML document along with any necessary resources such as CSS, JavaScript, and images.</li>
                <li><strong>Rendering</strong>: The browser parses the HTML and CSS to build the Document Object Model (DOM) and apply styles. JavaScript is executed to add interactivity and dynamic content.</li>
                <li><strong>Display</strong>: The final rendered page is displayed in the browser window, allowing users to interact with and view the content.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Page Load Time</h3>
            <p>Several factors influence page load time:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Network Speed</strong>: Faster internet connections result in quicker data transfer between the server and the browser.</li>
                <li><strong>File Size</strong>: Larger files, such as images and scripts, take longer to download and process.</li>
                <li><strong>Server Performance</strong>: The speed and capacity of the server affect how quickly it can deliver content to the client.</li>
                <li><strong>Browser Efficiency</strong>: Different browsers have varying performance characteristics and may handle rendering and JavaScript execution differently.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To optimize page load time, developers can use techniques such as compressing files, leveraging browser caching, optimizing images, and minimizing the use of large or blocking scripts.</p>
